The Strength Shop Hercules Massage Mobility Ball is 9cm diameter, bigger than a lacrosse ball, and great for relieving tightness in your muscles. It is made from EVA material, and is great to use against a wall or on the floor. 

With it being smaller than a foam roller it can get those hard to reach places and that you can sometimes struggle to hit with a roller. The grid texture on the surface helps to further get into the muscle to relieve the tension. A great piece of kit for anyone who is serious about recovery!
