Black double prong roller buckle tapered weightlifting belt.

These belts are made from artificial leather and give excellent support when lifting. Slightly more supple than standard leather belts, they mould to the contours of the back/body whilst providing unsurpassed support and protection to the back when training/lifting.

8mm thick.

60mm wide at the front/buckle, tapering up to 100mm wide at the back.
