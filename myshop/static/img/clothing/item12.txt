Strength Shop Coyotes- Weightlifting Shoes, excellent quality at an affordable price. 

Primarily used for Olympic Weightlifting, they are also used by Powerlifters and Strength Athletes for Squats . They have a 37mm heel rise which allows for a more upright squat position and more depth. The solid wooden midsole means more force is transfered from lifter to floor and the weight is evenly distributed under the shoe. 

If you have ever squatted in a pair of running shoes you will know how the cushioned heel compresses and moves under the load which isnt going to win you any PBs. The solid heel of our Coyotes removes the soft squashy air bubble and means that when you press out of the hole all you energy goes into moving the bar. 

They are also excellent for overhead pressing events and Strongman (log, axle, etc). Their solid heel and flat sole provide a solid base to press from.
