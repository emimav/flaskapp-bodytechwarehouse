Advantages

    The sole is thin and flat to decrease pulling distance. A thin sole means the barbell is higher up from the floor relative to the athlete. This allows for more weight to be lifted since the pulling distance becomes shorter.
    Specialized footwear protects the feet from injuries related to heavy lifting. Protects athletes' feet from platypodia (flattening of the arches).

    This shoe provides maximum stability for the ankle.

    The soles are made from materials that do not have any give which results in a good surface to push against. The pattern on the outsole minimizes slipping.
