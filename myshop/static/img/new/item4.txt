Straps are fully black in colour, green straps in photos are for illustration purposes

Strength Shop Suspension Straps are great for safety catching for squatting (without damaging your barbell like hard safety catchers can), suspended good mornings, suspended push-ups, rack lockouts for bench, and much more - they are a great versatile product! The webbing and chains are extremely strong for holding huge weights.

Suspension straps are a much better option than using chains that will tear up expensive bars because our suspension straps go directly over the rack and under the bar never leaving scratches or a nicked up bar. Better than regular safety catchers as they are much less harsh on your barbell in the event of a failed lift!

A great buy for anyone who is serious about safety when lifting.

Can be adjusted from 122-160cm in length.

Max load rating - 500kg (This is for straps only, the equipment you attach it to may be rated to less)

Note: Photos are for illustration purposes only. It is the users responsibility to ensure that the suspension straps are attached to equipment able to support the load in use.
