15kg Riot Bumper Plate (price is for one plate, not a pair)

These plates are coated in urethane rather than rubber making them extremely durable and even more robust than our core range, and in conjunction with IWF colours. The plates will bounce less and absorb more of the noise compared to regular bumper plates.

Now with a 10-year guarantee against splitting/cracking of the plates.

We have heard of many people asking about if our bumper plates 'split or crack after use'. We've sold thousands of them over the years, as well as using them extensively ourselves in training, and have never heard of this happening to any of them. To give you peace of mind and to back this up, we're now selling these bumpers with a 10-year guarantee against splitting/cracking of them (5's are excluded from the guarantee).

70mm width, 450mm diameter.

Urethane outer coating
