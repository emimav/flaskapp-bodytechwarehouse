The Strength Shop Hex/Trap Bar

The Hex bar might be one of the strangest pieces of gym equipment you will see in the gym today. Don't let that put you off though, it's an excellent addition to any serious strength and conditioning set-up.

One reason for this is it's ability to reduce tension on the lumbar spine whilst developing lower body power. It does this by allowing you to step “into” the bar instead of standing behind it. This means you will be able to drive more weight off the floor with your hips and legs in a more upright position without the strength of your back coming into question.

The Hex bar is also a useful tool for teaching beginners how to deadlift without the dangers of weak backs and poor flexibility getting in their way, and for tall athletes who struggle to deadlift conventionally.

The Strength Shop Hex bar has been improved with the help of feedback from our customers over the years. It now boasts longer sleeves compared to other brands versions which will now hold more plates. The bar has now also been redesigned to fit in most racks, cages or rigs.
